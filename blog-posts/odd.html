          <p>Saying Assassin's Creed Odyssey is big is an understatement. This ancient Greek world expands long past the expected horizon. And every inch of it seems purposeful like an artwork consisting of days of artistry and hard-work. Compared
            to the majority of its predecessors, it is one of the most engaging games in the series. </p>

          <p>It all begins at the onset of the Peloponnesian War; A conflict between Athens and Sparta over the rule of Ancient Greece. The protagonist is a misthios doing odd jobs around the distant island of Kephallonia. Eventually this leads to
            them being hired to kill a general and pulled into the greater Greek world of Assassin's Creed Odyssey. </p>

          <h3>Anything but Spartan</h3>
          <hr>

          <p>This world is beautiful and vibrantly colourful. The islands are surrounded by the rolling blue Aegean Sea and are home to a variety of stunning locales. They’re not static either as people and animals move through these environments with a natural feel.
            Even the ocean is home to fish, sharks and jellyfish. The final contributing aspect of this beautiful rendition of ancient Greece is the powerful lighting system which brings everything to life. Flaws are insignificant and almost never game-breaking.</p>

          <p>The game is fairly difficult, without a mastery of the stealth and combat elements. As guards and warriors gather up to chase you, it becomes a dance of death. Doing this repeatedly can become frustrating before you eventually find the best way through.
            But if you understand the controls, enemies which are many levels higher than you can be defeated. With good control, combat becomes engaging despite the repetitivity. </p>

            <figure class="featured-image">
              <img src="../images/blog-entry-images/odd-images/abilities.jpg" alt="">
            </figure>

          <p>Sneakier solutions are often better in many situations, and these solutions are what propels Odyssey forward. They are a complex puzzle to solve with all the player’s abilities. Free-climbing allows you to scale walls and attack from above and crouching hides you
            from view allowing a sneaky assassination. And more skills can be unlocked to perform even greater feats. </p>

          <p>This difficulty level combined with the fascinating environment and intrigue of the period, makes Assassins Creed Odyssey an interesting, entertaining and even fun game to be immersed in. And the great open world only adds to this engaging gameplay. </p>

          <p>The graphics of Assassin's Creed Odyssey really immerse you in this rendition of Ancient Greece. Every detail is considered within the great open world environment, from the clouds to the depths of the ocean. Although, it can use your GPU heavily, it is worth it to
            see the wonders this game has to offer. </p>

          <h3>Write your own story</h3>
          <hr>

          <p>Unlike its predecessors, you can choose a protagonist to play through the game. Kassandra or Alexios. Although they don’t change the story in a major way, the voice acting differs between the characters, with Kassandra having a more consistent performance than her counterpart. </p>

          <p>They make it possible to write your own story, as their personalities are whatever you decide them to be. You can be a serial killer, a conscious mercenary or whoever you decide. However these choices don’t come without consequences. </p>

          <figure class="featured-image">
            <img src="../images/blog-entry-images/odd-images/fighters.jpg" alt="">
          </figure>

          <p>One of the ways that Odyssey enforces these consequences is through it’s new notoriety system. As more crimes are committed, bounty is going to be put on your head. This leads to procedurally generated mercenaries hunting you down throughout the world. </p>

          <h3>Mamma Mia</h3>
          <hr>

          <p>Accompanying you throughout the world is a fantastic soundtrack. It reflects your current situation and that feeling of a Greek tragedy. This is no surprise because it was scored by award-winning composer duo, The Flight who have worked in high-profile video games previously. </p>

          <p>Regions are divided by sound, reflecting the people and environment of the area. Attica, home of the Athenians, for example, is known for learning and philosophy. So it was given a more classical and calm sound. On the other hand, the tougher islands have a rough and more improvised theme. </p>

          <p>Beyond the extensive main story, there is still so much to discover with several DLC and a heap of remaining quests to complete. Although it is not a truly replayable game, the mass of content in one playthrough will keep you going for a very long time. </p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <hr>

          <p>Assassins Creed Odyssey is a masterpiece in world-building, story and immersive gameplay. A few strokes may be a bit out of place but mean nothing in the grand scheme of the game. And with an enormous amount of content, Ubisoft’s recreation of Ancient Greece is
            a wonderful game to immerse yourself in. It is up there as one of the greatest open-world roleplaying games in this generation. </p>
